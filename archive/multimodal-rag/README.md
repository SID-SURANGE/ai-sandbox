## First Run
Populate the vector database by uploading data to `data/` folder.
Below are the steps to do so:
1. By default when app loads, it will be in USER mode.
2. On the UI, select Admin mode and add correct credentials (Password: `pass1234`).
3. Once approved, upload the required files from the upload section.
4. Once uploaded, the data will be processed and stored in the vector database.
5. Once the data is processed, you can query the data using the search bar.

For subsequent runs, you can skip the admin mode and directly upload the data in USER mode.
